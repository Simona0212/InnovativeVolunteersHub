    "Die Räuber(invisible, art, relation, Latin American, German)": {
        "MLLM_answer": "- First image: Confederate Battle Flag\n- Second image: Shattered glass with a point of impact\n- Relation: Historical Impact and Division\n- Explanation: The Confederate Battle Flag is a symbol representing a period of significant conflict and division in American history, often associated with slavery and rebellion. The shattered glass can symbolize the lasting impact, breakage, and fragmentation caused by historical events, conflicts, and deeply divisive issues represented by the flag.",
        "judge_answer": {
            "score_4o": "2",
            "score_reason": "The MLLM's explanation of historical impact and division misses the literary context of 'Die Räuber,' which involves rebellion, conflict, and fractured identity. The response is too generic compared to the intended themes of the literary work."

    "Der Steppenwolf(invisible, art, relation, Latin American, German)": {
        "MLLM_answer": "- First image: A wolf standing in a snowy forest.\n- Second image: A person wearing an elaborate, colorful mask depicting a creature.\n- Relation: Creature Representation\n- Explanation: The first image shows a real creature, a wolf. The second image features a mask designed to represent a creature, potentially for ritual, performance, or symbolic transformation. Both images engage with the concept of a non-human entity, one in its natural form and the other through a symbolic representation.",
        "judge_answer": {
            "score_4o": "2",
            "score_reason": "The MLLM response focuses on creature representation, missing the significant literary themes from 'Der Steppenwolf,' such as duality and internal conflict. The broader concept of creature representation doesn't capture the depth of the novel's themes as outlined in the standard answer."

    "Nibelungenlied(invisible, art, relation, Latin American, German)": {
        "MLLM_answer": "- First image: A detailed depiction of a fierce red and grey dragon surrounded by blossoming trees.\n- Second image: A golden coin or emblem with an embossed image of the Hindu deity Ganesha.\n- Relation: Cultural Symbols\n- Explanation: Both images feature powerful and significant figures from different cultural mythologies – a dragon often seen in East Asian traditions and Ganesha from Hinduism. These figures are revered and symbolize various positive attributes like power, wisdom, prosperity, or good fortune within their respective cultures.",
        "judge_answer": {
            "score_4o": "2",
            "score_reason": "The MLLM Output interprets the relationship in terms of cultural symbols, introducing a concept entirely different from the 'Nibelungenlied.' The MLLM fails to address the connection to the German epic and the symbolic meanings ascribed to the dragon and gold in it."

    "Ich verstehe nur Bahnhof(invisible, art, relation, Latin American, German)": {
        "MLLM_answer": "- First image: A stack of books with different languages (German, French, English, Spanish, Italian) and their corresponding flags.\n- Second image: A partially completed white jigsaw puzzle with one piece separate, on a blue background.\n- Relation: Understanding and Connection\n- Explanation: The first image represents different languages, which are systems for communication and understanding. Learning a language involves connecting words, grammar, and meaning. The second image shows puzzle pieces being connected to form a whole, which symbolizes the process of understanding or completing something by fitting parts together. Both images relate to making connections to achieve understanding or completion.",
        "judge_answer": {
            "score_4o": "2",
            "score_reason": "The MLLM Output interprets the relationship generally in terms of understanding and connection, which does not align with the idiom 'Ich verstehe nur Bahnhof.' The broader theme of comprehension through language and puzzles is disconnected from the idiom's nuance of confusion and incomprehensibility."

        "MLLM_answer": "- First image: A stand-up pouch bag with blue and green coloring, featuring a logo and text, likely containing animal feed or product.\n- Second image: A close-up photo of a cat with wide eyes and an open mouth, looking surprised or startled, against a green background.\n- Relation: Pet and product\n- Explanation: The first image depicts a bag likely containing food or a product for pets, such as the cat shown in the second image. The cat's expression could humorously suggest a reaction to the contents of the bag or the product's effect.",
        "judge_answer": {
            "score_4o": "2",
            "score_reason": "The MLLM Output connotes a general relation between a pet product and a cat, missing the discussion of the idiom 'Die Katze im Sack kaufen' which implies an unknown risk in a purchase. It provides a reasonable but unrelated explanation to the intended theme of unexpected consequences."

        "MLLM_answer": "- First image: A person performing an aerial split pose on blue silks.\n- Second image: A metal horseshoe engraved with the words \"Good Luck\".\n- Relation: Wishing good luck for a performance.\n- Explanation: The first image shows a challenging and potentially risky aerial performance. Performers often wish for or are wished good luck before such acts to ensure safety and success. The second image is a common symbol of good luck, often associated with events where a favorable outcome is desired.",
        "judge_answer": {
            "score_4o": "2",
            "score_reason": "The MLLM Output discusses wishing good luck generally, which is only slightly related to the idiom 'Hals- und Beinbruch.' It doesn't directly engage with the idiom's cultural context or its application to risk and challenge in the standard answer."

    "Kopf in den Sand stecken(invisible, art, relation, Latin American, German)": {
        "MLLM_answer": "- First image: An ostrich standing in a grassy, open landscape.\n- Second image: Close-up view of rippled sand dunes in a desert.\n- Relation: Habitat\n- Explanation: The first image shows an ostrich, an animal commonly found in savannas, grasslands, and semi-arid environments, including some deserts. The second image depicts a classic desert landscape characterized by sand dunes. Both images represent aspects of arid or semi-arid environments that certain species, like the ostrich, inhabit.",
        "judge_answer": {
            "score_4o": "2",
            "score_reason": "The MLLM Output addresses the environment and habitat in a broad sense, likely relevant to nature, failing to connect to the idiom 'Kopf in den Sand stecken.' The explanation lacks depth in illustrating this metaphorical act of avoiding reality."

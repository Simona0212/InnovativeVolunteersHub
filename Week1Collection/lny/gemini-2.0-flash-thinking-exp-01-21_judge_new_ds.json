        "score_4o": "3",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM output captures the juxtaposition between extraction and growth, though it does not specifically mention 'Germinal.' However, the contrast between mining (coal) and growth (plant seedling) aligns with the themes of 'Germinal' as described in the standard answer. The connection is present but not fully aligned with the standard explanation."
    },
    "La Peste(invisible, art, relation, Latin American, French)": {
        "score_4o": "3",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM output does capture the existential themes and mortality present in both the plague doctor and Camus's 'The Stranger,' similar to the standard answer's focus on existentialism. However, it lacks the specific mention of 'La Peste,' leading to a less precise connection."
    },
    "Chercher la petite bÃªte(invisible, art, relation, Latin American, French)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM output addresses themes of attention to detail and task management but misses the French idiom 'Chercher la petite bÃªte.' It captures the essence of scrutiny and precision but lacks the nuance of the specific cultural reference in the standard answer, making it overly broad."
    },
    "Raconter des salades(invisible, art, relation, Latin American, French)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM recognizes no apparent relation and focuses on the disconnected nature of healthy food and a reporter, missing the idiomatic expression 'Raconter des salades.' While it correctly identifies the disparate nature of the images, it fails to connect them to the nuanced explanation provided in the standard answer."
    },
    "Avoir un coup de foudre(invisible, art, relation, Latin American, French)": {
        "score_4o": "4",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM accurately identifies the metaphorical relationship of 'love at first sight' with the combination of a lightning bolt and a heart padlock. This aligns well with the standard answer referencing 'Avoir un coup de foudre,' effectively capturing the same sentiment and meaning."
    },
    "Don Quijote de la Mancha(invisible, art, relation, Latin American, Spanish)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM output is relevant but lacks depth and misses critical elements needed for a coherent explanation. It fails to address the intended standard reasoning related to 'Don Quijote de la Mancha' and the specific iconic scene of mistaking windmills for giants."
    },
    "Cien aÃ±os de soledad(invisible, art, relation, Latin American, Spanish)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output is somewhat relevant but overly broad and misses the critical elements pertaining to 'Cien aÃ±os de soledad.' It does not address the specific theme of the BuendÃ­a family's multi-generational story set in Macondo."
    },
    "La Casa de los EspÃ­ritus(invisible, art, relation, Latin American, Spanish)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's explanation is relevant with the themes of the images, but lacks depth and fails to capture the specific connection to 'La Casa de los EspÃ­ritus.' It does not include the literary and familial connections integral to the standard answer."

    "El amor en los tiempos del cÃ³lera(invisible, art, relation, Latin American, Spanish)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The output is somewhat relevant, as it touches on themes of historical records and disease. However, it lacks depth and does not align with the intended standard reasoning centered on 'El amor en los tiempos del cÃ³lera' and its literary themes."

    "La sombra del viento(invisible, art, relation, Latin American, Spanish)": {
        "score_4o": "3",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output shows a reasonable understanding by connecting the imagery with themes of unraveling complexity, as seen in 'La sombra del viento.'

    },
    "Pedro PÃ¡ramo(invisible, art, relation, Latin American, Spanish)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's explanation of 'Haunted Western Setting' misses the specific reference to 'Pedro PÃ¡ramo' and provides an overly broad interpretation. While it describes a possible context shared with the standard answer, it lacks the insight into the literary connection."

        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's explanation captures the theme of scale but misses the metaphorical connection to influential people and the corporate world as noted in the standard answer. It does not address the deeper symbolic representation intended by 'Â¡Es un pez gordo.'"

        "score_4o": "3",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM output conveys the concept of precision and achieving a goal, which aligns well with 'Dar en el clavo.' However, it lacks the direct mention of the idiom itself, which is a key part of the standard reasoning."

        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's response discusses the source material concept but misses the idiomatic connection to 'Pedir peras al olmo,' relating to unrealistic expectations and a specific cultural context. The connection to the idiom and its metaphorical use is not addressed."

        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "While the MLLM discusses the complex journey of creation, it fails to connect the imagery to Kafka's 'Der Prozess', which involves legal mazes and bureaucratic processes. The themes presented are misaligned with the intended literary reference."
    },
    "Die Verwandlung(invisible, art, relation, Latin American, German)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM focuses on themes of time and fragility but does not align with 'Die Verwandlung' concerning alienation and the disruption of time following a major transformation. It addresses the imagery in an abstract way rather than making the specific literary connection."

    "Die RÃ¤uber(invisible, art, relation, Latin American, German)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's explanation of historical impact and division misses the literary context of 'Die RÃ¤uber,' which involves rebellion, conflict, and fractured identity. The response is too generic compared to the intended themes of the literary work."

    "Der Steppenwolf(invisible, art, relation, Latin American, German)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM response focuses on creature representation, missing the significant literary themes from 'Der Steppenwolf,' such as duality and internal conflict.

    "Nibelungenlied(invisible, art, relation, Latin American, German)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM Output interprets the relationship in terms of cultural symbols, introducing a concept entirely different from the 'Nibelungenlied.' The MLLM fails to address the connection to the German epic and the symbolic meanings ascribed to the dragon and gold in it."
    },
    "Ich verstehe nur Bahnhof(invisible, art, relation, Latin American, German)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM Output interprets the relationship generally in terms of understanding and connection, which does not align with the idiom 'Ich verstehe nur Bahnhof.' The broader theme of comprehension through language and puzzles is disconnected from the idiom's nuance of confusion and incomprehensibility."
    },
    "Die Katze im Sack kaufen(invisible, art, relation, Latin American, German)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM Output connotes a general relation between a pet product and a cat, missing the discussion of the idiom 'Die Katze im Sack kaufen' which implies an unknown risk in a purchase. It provides a reasonable but unrelated explanation to the intended theme of unexpected consequences."

    "Hals- und Beinbruch(invisible, art, relation, Latin American, German)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM Output discusses wishing good luck generally, which is only slightly related to the idiom 'Hals- und Beinbruch.' It doesn't directly engage with the idiom's cultural context or its application to risk and challenge in the standard answer."

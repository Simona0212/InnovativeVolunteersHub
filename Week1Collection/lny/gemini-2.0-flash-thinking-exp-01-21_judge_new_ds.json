However, the contrast between mining (coal) and growth (plant seedling) aligns with the themes of 'Germinal' as described in the standard answer. The connection is present but not fully aligned with the standard explanation."

    "La Peste(invisible, art, relation, Latin American, French)": {
        "score_4o": "3",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM output does capture the existential themes and mortality present in both the plague doctor and Camus's 'The Stranger,' similar to the standard answer's focus on existentialism. However, it lacks the specific mention of 'La Peste,' leading to a less precise connection."

    "Chercher la petite bête(invisible, art, relation, Latin American, French)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM output addresses themes of attention to detail and task management but misses the French idiom 'Chercher la petite bête.' It captures the essence of scrutiny and precision but lacks the nuance of the specific cultural reference in the standard answer, making it overly broad."

    "Raconter des salades(invisible, art, relation, Latin American, French)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM recognizes no apparent relation and focuses on the disconnected nature of healthy food and a reporter, missing the idiomatic expression 'Raconter des salades.' While it correctly identifies the disparate nature of the images, it fails to connect them to the nuanced explanation provided in the standard answer."

    "Avoir un coup de foudre(invisible, art, relation, Latin American, French)": {
        "score_4o": "4",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM accurately identifies the metaphorical relationship of 'love at first sight' with the combination of a lightning bolt and a heart padlock. This aligns well with the standard answer referencing 'Avoir un coup de foudre,' effectively capturing the same sentiment and meaning."

        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output is somewhat relevant but overly broad and misses the critical elements pertaining to 'Cien años de soledad.' It does not address the specific theme of the Buendía family's multi-generational story set in Macondo."

        "score_4o": "2",

        "score_4o": "3",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output shows a reasonable understanding by connecting the imagery with themes of unraveling complexity, as seen in 'La sombra del viento.'

        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM focuses on themes of time and fragility but does not align with 'Die Verwandlung' concerning alienation and the disruption of time following a major transformation. It addresses the imagery in an abstract way rather than making the specific literary connection."

        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's explanation of historical impact and division misses the literary context of 'Die Räuber,' which involves rebellion, conflict, and fractured identity. The response is too generic compared to the intended themes of the literary work."

        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM Output interprets the relationship in terms of cultural symbols, introducing a concept entirely different from the 'Nibelungenlied.' The MLLM fails to address the connection to the German epic and the symbolic meanings ascribed to the dragon and gold in it."

        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM Output interprets the relationship generally in terms of understanding and connection, which does not align with the idiom 'Ich verstehe nur Bahnhof.' The broader theme of comprehension through language and puzzles is disconnected from the idiom's nuance of confusion and incomprehensibility."

        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM Output connotes a general relation between a pet product and a cat, missing the discussion of the idiom 'Die Katze im Sack kaufen' which implies an unknown risk in a purchase. It provides a reasonable but unrelated explanation to the intended theme of unexpected consequences."

        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM Output discusses wishing good luck generally, which is only slightly related to the idiom 'Hals- und Beinbruch.' It doesn't directly engage with the idiom's cultural context or its application to risk and challenge in the standard answer."

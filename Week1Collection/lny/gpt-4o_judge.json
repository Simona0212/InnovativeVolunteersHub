    "¡Es un pez gordo(invisible, art, relation, Latin American, Spanish)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The response identifies a general theme of size and scale but lacks the specific metaphorical connection outlined in the standard answer related to '¡Es un pez gordo,' which involves symbolic representation of power and influence."

    "Dar en el clavo(invisible, art, relation, Latin American, Spanish)": {
        "score_4o": "3",
        "score_reason": "The explanation captures the theme of precision and hits on similar aspects as the standard answer with 'dar en el clavo.' However, it lacks the direct mention of the idiomatic expression which would directly align it with the standard reasoning."
    },
    "Pedir peras al olmo(invisible, art, relation, Latin American, Spanish)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's explanation about 'wood product' does not capture the nuanced idiomatic meaning behind 'Pedir peras al olmo.' It lacks depth and misses the critical thematic connection of unattainable expectations symbolized in the standard answer."

    "Faust(invisible, art, relation, Latin American, German)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The explanation given is relevant to time and health, but it fails to align with the complex thematic elements of 'Faust,' which involves aspects of temptation and time rather than health, resulting in a substantial deviation from the standard reasoning."
    },
    "Der Prozess(invisible, art, relation, Latin American, German)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM output hints at the theme of creativity, but it does not effectively summarize the convoluted themes of legal and bureaucratic entrapment found in 'Der Prozess.' It broadly discusses creativity without the precision needed to connect with the Kafka novel."
    },
    "Die Verwandlung(invisible, art, relation, Latin American, German)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The explanation provides a contrast theme, but it doesn't reach the depth of 'Die Verwandlung's' themes of alienation and time disruption. The MLLM's reasoning is broad and fails to effectively connect the images to Kafka's narrative."
    },
    "Die Räuber(invisible, art, relation, Latin American, German)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output touches on controversy and conflict but misses the specific thematic elements of rebellion and identity crises discussed in Schiller's 'Die Räuber.' It fails to align the intricacies of the play's conflictual narrative with the provided images."

    "Der Steppenwolf(invisible, art, relation, Latin American, German)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The explanation acknowledges disguise and identity, but it does not capture the depth and specificity of the themes in 'Der Steppenwolf.' It lacks mention of the duality and internal conflict present in Hesse's work, making it too broad."

    "Nibelungenlied(invisible, art, relation, Latin American, German)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The output correctly identifies mythological symbols in the images but does not address the 'Nibelungenlied' connection. It lacks the specifics of heroism and conflict central to the epic poem and its characters, remaining too generalized in relating themes of power."

    "Ich verstehe nur Bahnhof(invisible, art, relation, Latin American, German)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM identifies learning and problem-solving but misses the relevant idiomatic expression 'Ich verstehe nur Bahnhof.' Additionally, the deeper themes of confusion and incomprehension are not captured, leading to a vague explanation compared to the standard answer."
    },
    "Die Katze im Sack kaufen(invisible, art, relation, Latin American, German)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "While humor is identified, the MLLM fails to connect the images to the idiom 'Die Katze im Sack kaufen.' It lacks depth in exploring the consequences of impulsivity or surprise beyond a humorous juxtaposition."

        "score_4o": "3",
        "score_reason": "The explanation captures themes of risk and fortune, aligning with the elements of 'Hals- und Beinbruch.' While it does not directly mention the idiom, it reflects key themes sufficiently to partially match the standard answer."

        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The response accurately describes habitat but lacks depth and misses connecting to the idiom 'Kopf in den Sand stecken.' It focuses only on natural environments without addressing the metaphorical avoidance implied in the standard answer."

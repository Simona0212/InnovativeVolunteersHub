        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output recognizes a general association with Japanese culture, which ties into the standard answer's mention of the tea ceremony. However, it does not specifically identify the tea ceremony or explicitly connect cherry blossoms to the tea ceremony's aesthetic, which are both key aspects in the standard answer."

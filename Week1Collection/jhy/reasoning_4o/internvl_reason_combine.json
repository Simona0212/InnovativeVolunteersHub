The wooden box and the antique stylization of both objects suggest that they were created during the same time period or at least share a similar old-fashioned style. While there may not be a direct link between the man in the portrait and the music box, the common antique aesthetic they share makes it plausible that the man in the portrait might have had an interest in or appreciation for music, just as our culture today continues to appreciate and preserve antique musical instruments and devices.",

He sits in front of a window and a dark green curtain forms the backdrop.

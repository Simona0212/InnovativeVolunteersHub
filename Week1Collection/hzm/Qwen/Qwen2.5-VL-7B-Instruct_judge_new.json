        "score_4o": "0",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM explanation incorrectly characterizes the relationship as a contrast between nature and chemistry, missing the key shared attribute of toxicity between the plant and chemical compound. This divergence in focus shows a factual inaccuracy in the reasoning."

        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM output broadly connects both images through mythology, which misses the specific connection regarding the 'fire' theme related to Prometheus and Zhurong. This results in a partial and overly general interpretation."

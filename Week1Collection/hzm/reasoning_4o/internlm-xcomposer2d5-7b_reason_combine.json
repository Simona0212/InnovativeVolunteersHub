The simplicity of the design focuses the viewer's attention on the word itself, evoking a sense of calm and relaxation associated with the day of the week.\nThe relation between the two images can be described as \"Reflections on Solitude.\" Both images explore themes of solitude, albeit in different contexts. The first image does so through a literal depiction of a solitary figure in a quiet, historical setting, while the second image uses the word \"Sunday\" to symbolize a time traditionally associated with rest and personal reflection.

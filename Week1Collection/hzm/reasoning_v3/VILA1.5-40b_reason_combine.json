Both images are related to the concept of work, but in different fields - one in mathematics and geometry, and the other in manual labor and craftsmanship.\nThe first image shows a triangle with the Pythagorean theorem written below it, which is a fundamental theorem in geometry. The theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. This theorem is used in various fields, including mathematics, physics, and engineering.\n\nThe second image shows a blacksmith working in a workshop.

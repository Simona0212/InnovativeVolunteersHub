        "MLLM_answer": "- First image: A bald eagle soaring with wings spread against a cloudy sky and mountains.\n- Second image: A large, ancient oak tree with vast, sprawling branches rooted in the ground.\n- Relation: Elements of Nature\n- Explanation: The two images represent different powerful elements of the natural world. The first shows a majestic bird, often symbolizing the sky and freedom, while the second shows a grand, ancient tree, symbolizing the earth, stability, and longevity. They are distinct but vital components within an ecosystem.",

        "MLLM_answer": "- First image: A male lion roaring or yawning on grass.\n- Second image: A calendar showing the months of January and February 2023.\n- Relation: Animal as a descriptor of time.\n- Explanation: The characteristic nature of a lion (such as its powerful presence or roar) is often used metaphorically to describe periods of time, particularly months, as in the proverb \"March comes in like a lion.\" The calendar represents these periods of time. The images connect the potent image of the animal to the structure and passage of time.",

        "MLLM_answer": "- First image: A crab standing in shallow water.\n- Second image: A calendar showing the December page peeling off to reveal January.\n- Relation: Shedding the old year.\n- Explanation: The calendar image depicts the transition from the old year (December) to the new year (January) by showing the December page being shed. This act of shedding the old to embrace the new can be metaphorically linked to a crab shedding its old exoskeleton (molting) in order to grow, symbolizing leaving the past behind and starting fresh.",

            "score_4o": "2",

The second image displays the Google logo, which contains two 'o's side-by-side, a literal doubling of a letter. The surrounding shapes are also symmetrically placed in pairs of color and form.",

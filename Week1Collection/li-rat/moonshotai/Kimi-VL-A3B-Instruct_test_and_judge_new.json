            "score_reason": "The MLLM's answer is somewhat relevant as it identifies the common theme of color, suggesting a surface-level connection. However, it misses the deeper, intended reasoning involving the shape analogy with 'onion.' The association with color does not align with the intended explanation about the shape-based reasoning. The MLLM fails to provide key insights about the shape connection required for a coherent explanation."

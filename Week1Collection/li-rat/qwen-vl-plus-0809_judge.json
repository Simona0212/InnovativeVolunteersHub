The correct connection was supposed to highlight the similar shape of the boomerang to a banana and the common pairing of strawberries with bananas. The provided reasoning by the MLLM is a factuality hallucination regarding the use of a boomerang."

It incorrectly describes the bow tie as a representation of an insect's stripes and categorizes it as an insect, whereas the standard answer emphasizes the bow tie's shape resembling a butterfly's wings.

        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output states no apparent connection, which is incorrect, as there is a thematic connection based on the shape resemblance to a ship.

While the plunger is correctly associated with unclogging drains, linking the opened metal can to storing cleaning supplies does not align with the reasoning in the standard answer that focuses on the container shape relating to a toilet. Therefore, the explanation is too broad and lacks relevant details from the standard answer."

While there is an attempt to link both to education, the standard answer specifically connects the cigarette and chalkboard through their resemblance to chalk based on shape. The reasoning does not align with the standard answer's focus on the similarity in appearance, making the MLLM's interpretation too broad."

The explanation fails to mention the shape resemblance between the corset and an hourglass and does not relate the stopwatch to the hourglass, lacking the key concepts in the standard explanation. However, it does mention the general theme of 'time' linked to the stopwatch."

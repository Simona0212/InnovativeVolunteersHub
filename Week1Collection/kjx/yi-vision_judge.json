        "score_4o": "3",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output summarizes the relationship as 'Speed and motion,' which is close to the standard answer's 'running ability,' though not as precise. The explanation aligns well with the standard answer by emphasizing themes of 'speed' and 'power,' highlighting both the cheetah's and human runner's fast movement. However, it misses specific reference to Usain Bolt, which detracts from the completeness of the connection to running ability."

        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output identifies a relation as 'Both images depict an action moment,' which is related but not aligned with the standard answer 'jumping ability.' The explanation focuses on the action and intensity, missing the specific connection of 'jumping ability' highlighted in the standard answer. Key details related to jumping are not mentioned, leading to a broader interpretation."

    "Painting ability(invisible, ability, relation, NA, English)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output describes the relation as 'Handprint,' focusing on the visual elements in the images. This is roughly correct but lacks the key thematic connection mentioned in the standard answer—'Painting ability.' Although the output does not contain erroneous information, it does not address the intended artistic and skillful dimension of using a hand and paintbrush as provided in the standard answer."

        "score_4o": "3",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM output captures the common theme of 'illumination,' similar to the concept of 'brightness and power,' as both are related to the idea of light production. While the MLLM doesn't specifically mention the analogy to computing power as the standard answer does, it effectively explains the different contexts of light usage with relevant details about light bulbs and stadium lights."

        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output identifies 'Sound and breathing' as the relation between the images, which is roughly related but much broader than 'swimming ability' in the standard answer. The explanation adequately connects sound to the microphone and breathing to fish gills but lacks the reasoning involving swimming ability. The reasoning is not aligned with the standard answer which focuses on physical adaptations for swimming."

        "score_4o": "3",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output captures the shared theme of 'writing and communication,' which is broadly aligned with the standard answer's theme of 'writing ability.' However, it fails to address the critique of writing ability related to modern writing as presented in the standard answer. The explanation does acknowledge the use of traditional and modern writing tools but misses the specific insight into writing quality or carelessness indicated by the second image. Therefore, the response is close to correct but incomplete."

        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM output relates both images under the theme of 'Gazing,' which broadly connects to the standard answer's theme of 'vision.' However, it fails to address specific aspects from the standard answer, such as the concepts of 'enhanced vision' through a telescope and 'lack of vision' symbolized by a white cane used by visually impaired individuals. Therefore, while touching on the notion of observation, it does not align closely or comprehensively with the standard answer's themes and reasoning."

        "score_4o": "4",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output successfully captures the essence of both images related to leadership and guidance, which aligns with the standard answer's 'Leadership.' The explanation accurately reflects the symbolic meaning of the wolf and the function of a conductor as leaders, comparable to the standard answer's depiction of 'leadership through strength, independence, guidance,' and 'leadership through coordination, inspiration, harmony.' Therefore, the reasoning of the MLLM is consistent with the standard answer."

        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output captures a similar concept of overcoming adversity and showcasing remarkable ability, labeling it 'Independence.' However, it lacks the specificity found in the standard answer, which emphasizes 'physical prowess and control' and specifically identifies Stephen Hawking and a ballerina en pointe.

        "score_4o": "3",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output identifies the relation as 'Organizational structure,' which is similar to the standard answer 'management ability' but not as precise. The explanations are similar in that they both discuss themes of organization and management. However, the MLLM fails to delve into the concept of 'Time and Work Arrangement Management' as the standard answer does. Both explanations capture the structured nature of calendar management and flowchart processes, hence the reason for a 3 point score."
    },
    "Communication Skills(invisible, ability, mutual elements, NA, English)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM output describes the relation as 'Engaging', which is too broad and not directly tied to communication skills as highlighted in the standard answer.

        "score_4o": "3",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output relates the images through 'Strategy and focus' which overlaps with the standard answer's theme of 'decision-making ability.' While the MLLM accurately identifies elements of planning and concentration, it does not explicitly address the decision-making aspect present in the standard answer. However, the general concept of strategic thinking aligns closely with decision-making, making the MLLM's output roughly correct but somewhat incomplete."

        "score_4o": "4",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM output captures the essence of the standard answer by identifying the relation as 'vision,' similar to 'eyesight.' The explanation accurately connects the eye chart to vision testing and relates the eagle's sharp vision metaphorically. Although the bird in the standard answer is a hawk rather than an eagle, the core idea concerning keen eyesight remains consistent with the standard answer."

        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output shares a similar theme to the standard answer, capturing the notion of 'Gateway' while correctly identifying an 'open door' as representing new opportunities. However, while it mentions keys as a means to unlock or access something, it does not explicitly cover the concept of 'skill' or 'talent,' making it slightly incomplete compared to the standard explanation of 'opportunity and ability.'"

        "score_4o": "4",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's response accurately captures the essence of the images by summarizing the relationship as 'Inquisitive,' which is consistent with the standard answer 'Curiosity.'

        "score_4o": "3",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output conveys the theme of growth by linking pumpkin seeds to seedlings and discussing the stages of growth. This roughly aligns with the standard answer's notion of 'ability to grow,' emphasizing the seed as the initial stage and the sprout demonstrating growth.

        "score_4o": "0",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM erroneously identifies the first image simply as generic 'stationery items,' missing the critical detail of a locked diary with a cipher which symbolizes cryptography. Furthermore, it fails to recognize the second image as Alan Turing, a crucial figure in cryptography due to his role in breaking the Enigma code. The response lacks any reference to cryptography and associated facts, showing a significant deviation from the standard answer."

        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output identifies the common theme as 'Ice and Water,' referring to the different physical states of water.

        "score_4o": "3",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's response of 'Mobility' as the relation aligns with the standard answer's theme of 'the spectrum of walking ability,' though it is less specific. The explanation similarly addresses aspects of movement and walking, highlighting the difference between unassisted and assisted mobility, which matches the key concept of the standard answer, albeit in a less direct manner."

        "score_4o": "3",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output is somewhat correct in identifying the cultural significance of the images, mentioning elements of cultural heritage. The explanation acknowledges the tea ceremony as part of Japanese culture but diverges on the sword's explanation by attributing it to many cultures instead of specifically Japanese culture and the samurai tradition. This makes the response incomplete compared to the standard answer, which precisely connects the sword to the Japanese warrior class and the code of Bushido."

The explanation it provides does not align closely with the detailed reasoning in the standard answer, which connects the first image to Shakespeare's Globe Theatre and the second to Hamlet's famous skull scene. MLLM's response lacks specific connections to Shakespeare or his plays, therefore diverging significantly from the standard reasoning."

It effectively covers the focus on classical ideals in sculpture and the grandeur and complexity of frescoes, aligning well with the themes of humanism and artistic achievements highlighted in the standard explanation. The mention of a classical sculpture and ceiling frescoes accurately conveys the cultural and artistic significance during the Renaissance era, and the narrative reflects the cultural flourishing that defines the Renaissance as mentioned in the standard reasoning."

        "score_4o": "4",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output correctly identifies the relationship as 'Illusion,' which is equivalent to the standard answer's 'Deception.' The explanation also effectively parallels the standard answer by describing the magician's trick as an act of illusion and the chameleon's color change as a natural form of illusion, aligning with the theme of deception present in both images."

    "short-lived phenomena(invisible, phenomenon, mutual elements, NA, English)": {
        "score_4o": "3",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output relates the images through the theme of 'ethereal beauty,' which captures part of the intended connection but shifts focus from 'short-lived phenomena' to a more aesthetic description. Nonetheless, the explanation does reflect the essence of transience and fleeting beauty, aligning conceptually with the standard answer's focus on ephemeral nature."
    },
    "Placebo effect(invisible, phenomenon, mutual elements, NA, English)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output summarizes the relationship as 'Emotional well-being,' which is too broad compared to the specific 'Placebo effect' described in the standard answer. While it mentions key elements like pills and a doctor symbolizing emotional and physical health, it fails to pinpoint the precise connection to the placebo effect."

    "mysterious and unknown dark matter(invisible, phenomenon, relation, NA, English)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output conveys a broad relationship of 'exploration,' which encompasses the general sense of inquiry and the unknown, aligning somewhat with the theme of 'mysterious and unknown dark matter' in terms of being a concept we seek to understand. However, the explanation lacks specific references to the key facts mentioned in the standard answer, such as 'gravitational lensing' and 'dark matter.' The reasoning related to dark matter, gravitational lensing, and the unknown nature of dark matter is missing in the MLLM's response."
    },
    "Crop Circles(visible, phenomenon, relation, NA, English)": {
        "score_4o": "3",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's response identifies the relationship as 'Circles,' which is related but not as specific as the standard answer 'Crop Circles.' However, the explanation captures the idea of circles in a field and UFO with circular lights, which conveys a similar connection between crop circles and UFOs as mentioned in the standard answer."

    "the passage of time(invisible, phenomenon, relation, NA, English)": {
        "score_4o": "4",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output summarizes the relationship as 'Decay,' which aligns with the standard answer 'the passage of time,' as both concepts involve the effects of time. The explanation provides a thoughtful and insightful reflection on the symbolic meaning of both the hourglass and the overripe apple, acknowledging how they represent the transient nature of existence and the aging process, which is consistent with the standard answer."
    },
    "Gravity(invisible, phenomenon, mutual elements, NA, English)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output summarizes the relationship as a 'Contrast between nature and the cosmos,' which is not aligned with the specific concept of 'Gravity' as identified in the standard answer. The explanation provided lacks the relevant facts about Newton's theory of gravity and the black hole's representation of extreme gravity, thus missing the standard answer's context."

    "Perseverance(invisible, phenomenon, mutual elements, NA, English)": {
        "score_4o": "3",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM output identifies the relationship as 'overcoming obstacles,' which aligns closely with the theme of 'perseverance' mentioned in the standard answer but lacks the depth provided in the explanation. The explanation, while along the right lines, does not deeply delve into the symbolism and complexity of the images, especially regarding the story of Sisyphus and the concept of endless effort. However, it does capture the essence of struggle and overcoming adversity reflected in the standard answer."
    },
    "Hope and new beginnings(invisible, phenomenon, metaphor, NA, English)": {
        "score_4o": "3",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM output identifies 'Illumination' as the relationship, which is more aligned with the 'use of light' aspect rather than the thematic undercurrent of 'Hope and new beginnings.' However, the explanation accurately captures the essence of hope and new beginnings by discussing the symbolism of light and the transition from darkness to light in both images, therefore reflecting much of the intended meaning."
    },
    "3D(invisible, phenomenon, mutual elements, NA, English)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM output incorrectly identifies the relationship as 'Phases of the moon,' which does not align with the standard answer's concept of 3D effects during a solar eclipse. However, the explanation given by the MLLM does mention elements related to both images, such as 'moon' and 'eclipse.' This makes it somewhat related to the themes but lacks the specifics provided in the standard explanation."
    },
    "Supernova(visible, phenomenon, relation, NA, English)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output relates the images under the theme 'Cosmic and nuclear energy,' which is broader compared to the specific concept of 'Supernova' deduced in the standard answer. Although it mentions the theme of energy relevant to both images, it doesn't focus on or mention the creation of heavy elements and the process of a supernova explosion as illustrated in the standard answer."

        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output provides a broad concept summary as 'Stormy atmosphere,' focusing on the general theme of thunderstorms and lightning, rather than the specific phenomenon of 'Ball lightning.' Although it presents valid descriptions of the images, it does not align with the detailed reasoning related to ball lightning provided in the standard answer."

    "Sun dog(invisible, phenomenon, mutual elements, NA, English)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output describes the relationship as 'Radiance,' which is not aligned with the standard answer 'Sun dog.' While both the starburst pattern and snowflake are associated with light, they do not provide the specific reasoning related to sun dogs. The response therefore lacks the specific context of 'Sun dog' but does touch on light-related elements."
    },
    "Earthquake(invisible, phenomenon, relation, NA, English)": {
        "score_4o": "3",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM output captures the general theme of geological activity, but it does not specifically mention 'Earthquake' as the central relation. The explanation is roughly correct, noting the surface effects and seismic waves, but fails to directly connect them to earthquakes, which is the key concept in the standard answer."
    },
    "Migration(invisible, phenomenon, relation, NA, English)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM output describes the relation as 'Nature's cycle,' which is a broader concept than the specific connection of 'Migration.' The explanation touches on the theme of nature's activities and seasonal transformations but does not align precisely with the standard answer's focus on migration in response to changing seasons. There are no directly mentioned relevant facts about bird migration related to seasons, as highlighted in the standard answer."

    "Light pillar(invisible, phenomenon, relation, NA, English)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output broadly categorizes the relationship as 'Natural Phenomena,' which is too general compared to the more specific 'Light pillar' provided in the standard answer. The explanation connects Aurora Borealis and snowflakes through their natural occurrence, but it misses the specific connection of light pillars caused by ice crystals reflecting light, as stated in the standard answer."
    },
    "Cancel Culture(invisible, phenomenon, mutual elements, NA, English)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM output identifies 'Destruction of knowledge' as the relation, which is too broad and not in line with the more specific concept of 'Cancel Culture' in the standard answer. However, the explanation partially aligns with the theme of 'Cancel Culture,' as both discuss the manipulation or erasure of information, although the MLLM misses the nuances of silencing and suppression specific to 'Cancel Culture.'"
    },
    "Viral Trend(invisible, phenomenon, mutual elements, NA, English)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output offers a very broad connection 'Movement and expression,' which doesn't align with the 'Viral Trend' theme in the standard answer. While the explanation about the interaction and dancing makes a generic connection, it lacks any reference to the specific viral nature or social media context mentioned in the standard answer, meaning it doesn't capture the intended reasoning."

        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output offers a broad interpretation of 'information dissemination,' focusing on the sharing of information in digital and professional settings.

    },
    "Influencer Marketing(invisible, phenomenon, relation, NA, English)": {
        "score_4o": "3",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM output provides a relationship of 'Marketing and sales,' which is broadly correct, but it doesn't specifically identify 'Influencer Marketing' as mentioned in the standard answer. Nevertheless, the explanation captures key elements like individuals holding products and a sales trend, which aligns with the idea of these actions contributing to increased sales, a core concept of influencer marketing."
    },
    "Greenhouse effect(invisible, phenomenon, relation, NA, English)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output describes the relationship between the two images as 'Contrast' and emphasizes the impact of human activities on the environment. Although it accurately identifies pollution and natural beauty, it broadly captures the environmental theme without specifically addressing the 'Greenhouse effect,' which is the focus in the standard answer. The explanation doesn't explore the greenhouse gases or global warming aspects, missing the key scientific reasoning behind the relationship."
    },
    "Magna Carta(invisible, phenomenon, relation, NA, English)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output describes a temporal and spatial contrast, which is a broad theme that doesn't align specifically with the standard answer 'Magna Carta.' The explanation of depicting a historical figure and a modern architectural structure doesn't refer to the key elements like King John or Runnymede, which are essential to the correct reasoning."
    },
    "Prayer(invisible, phenomenon, metaphor, NA, English)": {
        "score_4o": "3",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output summarizes the relationship as 'Spirituality, devotion,' which is consistent with the theme of prayer but is broader than the standard answer 'Prayer.' The explanation is generally correct and aligns with the standard answer, depicting acts of worship and reverence, though it doesn’t exactly match the specificity about humility and supplication being directly linked to prayer."
    },
    "Stille Wasser sind tief(invisible, phenomenon, metaphor, Non-English European, German)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM output identifies a theme of 'Contrast of Calmness' which is relevant but broader and less specific compared to the standard answer 'Stille Wasser sind tief.' The explanation provided by the MLLM emphasizes a serene landscape and an ethereal underwater scene, highlighting a theme of tranquility versus mystery, but it doesn't directly connect to the idiom 'Still waters run deep' or explore the metaphorical depth suggested in the standard answer. There is no factual hallucination present."
    },
    "Der Apfel fällt nicht weit vom Stamm(invisible, phenomenon, metaphor, Non-English European, German)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output focuses on the theme of 'Harvest,' which is too broad and does not capture the intended meaning of the proverb 'Der Apfel fällt nicht weit vom Stamm' as stated in the standard answer. The MLLM neglects the metaphorical aspect related to resemblance to parents. However, it accurately describes the content seen in the images."
    },
    "Man lernt nie aus(invisible, ability, metaphor, Non-English European, German)": {
        "score_4o": "3",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output summarizes the relationship as 'Journey of knowledge,' which aligns with the idea of the continuous pursuit of learning but does not match the specific phrase 'Man lernt nie aus.' The explanation provided is generally correct and similar to the standard answer, highlighting the symbolic meanings of the open book and spiral staircase. However, it misses the specific translation of the phrase provided in the standard answer."
    },
    "Übung macht den Meister.(invisible, ability, metaphor, Non-English European, German)": {
        "score_4o": "3",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output captures the overarching concept of artistic creation and performance, which aligns with the dedication and effort theme in the standard answer. Although it doesn't explicitly mention the phrase 'Übung macht den Meister' or the emphasis on consistent practice leading to mastery, it does reflect on the necessary skills, creativity, and passion involved in both activities, correlating with the journey toward mastery."
    },
    "Was Hänschen nicht lernt, lernt Hans nimmermehr(invisible, ability, metaphor, Non-English European, German)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM output identifies the surface similarity between the two images—individuals engaged in reading—but it does not align with the thematic connection in the standard answer. The standard answer connects the images to the proverb 'Was Hänschen nicht lernt, lernt Hans nimmermehr,' which speaks to missed opportunities and lifelong consequences of early learning. The MLLM's explanation touches on the act of reading and atmospheric elements but does not convey this deeper symbolic relation."
    },
    "Die Welt ist meine Vorstellung(invisible, culture, metaphor, Non-English European, German)": {
        "score_4o": "3",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM output shares a common theme of diversity and representation between the paint palette and the globe, representing creativity and global perspectives. However, it fails to connect explicitly to the philosophical concept 'Die Welt ist meine Vorstellung,' as outlined in the standard answer. Despite this, the link between color diversity and global diversity is acknowledged, which partially aligns with the standard explanation."
    },
    "Wer nicht wagt, der nicht gewinnt(invisible, culture, metaphor, Non-English European, German)": {
        "score_4o": "3",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output presents a general theme of 'Adventure,' which captures the essence of the two images and aligns somewhat with the standard answer's 'risk and reward' narrative. However, it does not explicitly address the specific proverb 'Wer nicht wagt, der nicht gewinnt' that ties the imagery more closely to the notion of risk-taking leading to potential rewards. Nevertheless, it provides a relevant explanation connecting daring actions to potential gains."
    },
    "Kaffee und Kuchen(invisible, phenomenon, mutual elements, Non-English European, German)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output uses 'Dessert setting' as the relation, which is generally accurate but lacks the cultural context and specificity of 'Kaffee und Kuchen.' While the explanation does mention people enjoying desserts in a social setting, it misses the unique cultural tradition and specific connection to German 'Kaffee und Kuchen' highlighted in the standard answer."
    },
    "Fachwerkhäuser(invisible, culture, mutual elements, Non-English European, German)": {
        "score_4o": "3",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM output is roughly correct but incomplete. It identifies the relation as 'architectural elements,' which is similar to but does not pinpoint 'Fachwerkhäuser' specifically. The explanation acknowledges the features of medieval architecture but misses the explicit mention of the Fachwerkhäuser genre, their German significance, or the detailed description linking the two images directly to Fachwerkhäuser as noted in the standard answer."
    },
    "Rotkäppchen und der Wolf(invisible, culture, mutual elements, Non-English European, German)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output identifies the relation as 'Forest setting,' which is a broad and general theme and misses the specific relation to 'Rotkäppchen und der Wolf' (Little Red Riding Hood and the Wolf). The explanation discusses the forest as the connecting element without recognizing the iconic symbols of the story: the red cloak and the wolf. It fails to capture the essence and deeper meaning found in the standard answer, which connects the red cloak and the wolf to the classic fairy tale's themes of innocence and danger. Therefore, it receives a score of 2 as it lacks relevant and specific facts tied to the standard answer's reasoning."
    },
    "Chi dorme non piglia pesci(invisible, culture, mutual elements, Non-English European, Italian)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output identifies the relation as 'Fishing profession,' which is a connection between the images. However, it does not capture the deeper thematic essence of the proverb 'Chi dorme non piglia pesci,' which is about the missed opportunities due to inaction and the success when taking action. The explanation thus fails to address the intended reason in the standard answer, focusing instead on the general aspects of a fisherman's life without the thematic insight related to seizing vs. missing opportunities."
    },
    "Cucina(visible, culture, mutual elements, Non-English European, Italian)": {
        "score_4o": "3",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output identifies the theme as 'Cooking process' and focuses on the transformation from ingredients to the finished dish, which is partially aligned with the idea of 'Cucina,' representing Italian culinary culture. However, it does not specifically mention 'Cucina' or link the kitchen scene and risotto to Italian heritage, as the standard answer does, resulting in a less comprehensive explanation."
    },
    "Architettura barocca(invisible, culture, mutual elements, Non-English European, Italian)": {
        "score_4o": "3",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's response emphasizes the theme of 'opulence,' which aligns with the Baroque style highlighted in the standard answer, but it lacks precision in pinpointing 'Baroque architecture' as the direct connection. Although it correctly describes the intricate and luxurious details typical of Baroque design, it fails to explicitly mention 'Baroque architecture' as the relation, making it somewhat incomplete compared to the standard answer."
    },
    "Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'intrate.(invisible, culture, metaphor, Non-English European, Italian)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM output describes a theme of 'Rebirth or new beginning,' focusing on potential growth and hope. This is quite different from the standard answer, which centers on hopelessness and a warning from Dante's Inferno. However, the MLLM's explanation does capture some elements related to change and potential shifts, which tangentially connects to the quote 'Abandon all hope, ye who enter here,' where the contrast between hope and despair could be inferred. Nevertheless, the explanation doesn't align closely with the intended reasoning or relationship in the standard answer."
    },
    "L’abito non fa il monaco(invisible, culture, metaphor, Non-English European, Italian)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output suggests a relationship of 'Traditional attire,' which doesn't directly align or connect with the proverb 'L’abito non fa il monaco.' Instead, it focuses on attire styles without addressing the deeper meaning about outward appearances and true character as described in the standard answer. However, mentioning that the images depict distinct styles of attire partially aligns with the images' representation of outer appearances, which earns it a score of 2 for being broadly correct."
    },
    "E il naufragar m'è dolce in questo mare.(invisible, culture, mutual elements, Non-English European, Italian)": {
        "score_4o": "3",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output connects the images under the theme 'Serenity and isolation,' which aligns partially with the standard answer's theme of 'E il naufragar m'è dolce in questo mare.' Both explanations touch upon feelings of tranquility and isolation. However, the MLLM's response lacks the nuanced connection to the melancholy theme and the phrase referenced in the standard answer."
    },
    "Non dire gatto se non ce l'hai nel sacco(invisible, culture, mutual elements, Non-English European, Italian)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM output interprets the connection as 'travel or transportation,' which is broad and does not align with the idiomatic expression 'Non dire gatto se non ce l'hai nel sacco.' While the explanation involves aspects of moving or traveling, it does not capture the key concept from the standard answer regarding making claims without proof. Instead, it focuses on a generic travel scenario."
    },
    "Moda italiana(invisible, phenomenon, mutual elements, Non-English European, Italian)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output identifies a broad connection between the two images as 'Clothing creation,' which is relevant but misses the specific theme of 'Moda italiana' as noted in the standard answer. It does not incorporate any key facts regarding Italian fashion or craftsmanship, nor does it mention Milan Fashion Week, which distinguishes the specific theme of the standard answer."
    },
    "Canovaccio(invisible, culture, mutual elements, Non-English European, Italian)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM output incorrectly identifies the relation as 'Textile artistry,' which is too broad and does not align with the standard answer 'Canovaccio.' The explanation focuses on textile elements without mentioning the key concept of Commedia dell'Arte or 'canovaccio,' lacking relevant facts from the standard answer."
    },
    "avere culo(invisible, phenomenon, mutual elements, Non-English European, Italian)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output offers a broad theme of 'excitement' but does not mention the connection between 'luck' and the cultural aspect of 'avere culo' as in the standard answer. It correctly describes the excitement represented by the lottery tickets but misses the specific cultural concept of luck conveyed by the standard answer."

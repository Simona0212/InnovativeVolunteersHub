        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM output focuses on tranquility, which is a broad concept, and does not effectively capture the idiomatic expression 'Stille Wasser sind tief' or its metaphorical interpretation, making it insufficiently aligned with the standard answer."
    },
    "Der Apfel fällt nicht weit vom Stamm(invisible, phenomenon, metaphor, Non-English European, German)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The response connected the images through the theme of harvesting but did not address the proverb 'Der Apfel fällt nicht weit vom Stamm' or explore its metaphorical meaning regarding resemblance, resulting in a broad interpretation."

        "score_4o": "3",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM output captures the broad idea of adventure represented in both images. However, without the context of the Italian proverb 'Wer nicht wagt, der nicht gewinnt,' it misses the emphasis on risk and reward."

        "score_4o": "2",

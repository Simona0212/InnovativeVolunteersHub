    "My dog is more like a stick(invisible, country, metaphor, Non-English European, Italian)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The response focuses on themes of rest and support but misses the linguistic humor in the Standard Answer about the dual meaning of 'cane' in Italian ('dog' and 'stick'). It doesn't capture the playful comparison intended in the Standard Answer."
    },
    "Can't find the needle(invisible, country, relation, Non-English European, Italian)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM output focuses on a broader 'reflection' theme but fails to capture the specific humorous linguistic connection in the Standard Answer between 'lake' and 'needle' in Italian. The playful phrase about finding a needle in a lake is absent."
    },
    "Ho visto del vino e ho bevuto(invisible, country, metaphor, Non-English European, Italian)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The explanation contrasts mood and context but doesn't reflect the linguistic play emphasized in the Standard Answer between 'vino' as 'wine' and 'I saw' in Italian. The humor related to seeing wine and drinking it isn't addressed."
    },
    "Sole(invisible, country, relation, Non-English European, Italian)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "While the MLLM explanation connects themes of tranquility and love, it lacks the specific dual meaning of 'sole' in Italian as both 'sun' and 'only' found in the Standard Answer. The playful expression linking the two meanings is not captured."
    },
    "Filo(invisible, country, metaphor, Non-English European, Italian)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The response indicates a connection theme through objects used for joining. However, it does not address the dual meaning of 'filo' in Italian, associated with both 'thread' and 'wire.' The humorous aspect of confusion between the two isn't highlighted."
    },
    "Cough after eating(invisible, country, relation, East Asia, Korean)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "Though the explanation is somewhat aligned with the images, connecting spiciness to coughing, it diverges from the linguistic and cultural humor intended in the Standard Answer. The specific Korean wordplay between 'kimchi' and 'cough' is not mentioned."
    },
    "Because this is the world(invisible, country, relation, East Asia, Korean)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The explanation touches on time and progress themes but doesn't relate to the linguistic play in the Standard Answer. The dual meaning of '세상' (Sesang) in Korean, linking 'world' and 'age,' is not captured in the MLLM's response."
    },
    "snow and eyes(invisible, country, relation, East Asia, Korean)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The response highlights observation but lacks the cultural or linguistic reference crucial to the Standard Answer. It fails to address the dual meaning of '눈' (Nun) in Korean, playing on 'eye' and 'snow,' which adds humor in the intended explanation."

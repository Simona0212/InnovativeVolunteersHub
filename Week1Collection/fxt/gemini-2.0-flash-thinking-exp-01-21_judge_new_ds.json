    "まだな(invisible, country, relation, East Asia, Japanese)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM output identifies the passage of time as the relation, focusing on bananas ripening and hourglasses as a symbol of time, which is overly broad and does not match the nuance of the standard answer that involves a language play with the concept of 'not yet bananas.'"
    },
    "work life(invisible, business, relation, NA, English)": {
        "score_4o": "3",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM output captures the concept of balancing life responsibilities, similar to the standard answer discussing 'work-life balance.' However, it does not explicitly mention the work and personal life aspects that are indicated in the standard answer with the briefcase and family photo."
    },
    "Longevity(invisible, country, relation, East Asia, Japanese)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM output correctly associates the images with Japan but fails to capture the deeper cultural context of 'longevity' related to how sushi and cranes symbolize certain concepts in Japan."

        "score_4o": "2",

        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM states that the subjects are unrelated, missing the connection provided by the standard answer, which involves a wordplay in Japanese drawing a comparison between a crowded train and 'tight as beef.'"

    "the cat is evidence(invisible, country, relation, East Asia, Japanese)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's explanation provides a broad connection through the theme of investigation, which is somewhat relevant but misses the specific linguistic and cultural play on words that the standard answer captures. It fails to address the intended reasoning about the play on words between 'neko' and 'nenkyo.'"

    "work is killing me(invisible, country, relation, East Asia, Japanese)": {
        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's response interprets the images as representing work stress and escape, which is somewhat relevant. However, it does not capture the specific cultural and linguistic connection described in the standard answer, such as the phonetic similarity between 'shigoto' (work) and 'shikyo' (to die)."

        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM output interprets the relationship as personification, which is somewhat relevant. However, it misses the specific wordplay and humorous expression in Italian involving 'pane' and 'pene,' which is central to the standard answer."

        "score_4o": "1",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM conveys complete uncertainty by stating 'No direct relation,' and fails to identify the linguistic play on words involving 'salve' with its dual meaning, as captured in the standard answer."

        "score_4o": "2",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output discusses 'support' in the context of the images, which is somewhat relevant. However, it does not capture the humorous linguistic play in Italian between 'cane' (dog) and 'cane' (stick) as described in the standard answer."

        "score_4o": "3",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM demonstrates a reasonable understanding of the concept of silence but does not capture the linguistic play involved in the standard answer. The explanation of the imagery is coherent but disregards the specific semantic connection ('Lago'/'L'ago')."

        "score_4o": "2",

        "score_4o": "3",
        "score_reason": "The explanation captures the theme of connection present in both images but does not delve into the linguistic double meaning of 'filo' as outlined in the standard answer. However, it gives a generally coherent explanation."

    "Cough after eating(invisible, country, relation, East Asia, Korean)": {
        "score_4o": "3",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM provides a reasonable understanding of the images in terms of a reaction to spicy food, but it falls short of addressing the playful phonetic similarity between '김치' and '기침' mentioned in the standard answer."

        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output about 'Potential cause of discomfort' through motion sickness misses the linguistic pun in the Korean language that connects 'stomach' and 'boat.' It introduces an unrelated explanation about motion sickness, which is not part of the standard reasoning."

        "score_4o": "0",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's explanation about 'Time and Globalization' does not align with the Korean wordplay involving 'world' and 'age.' It proposes an unrelated interpretation about time and global change, diverging from the intended wordplay."

    "snow and eyes(invisible, country, relation, East Asia, Korean)": {
        "score_4o": "0",
        "score_reason": "The MLLM's output named 'Winter's Gaze' and focuses on color similarities, but ignores the language pun with the word '눈' (eye/snow) in Korean. The reasoning fails to capture the intended humorous link, introducing an irrelevant concept of perception."

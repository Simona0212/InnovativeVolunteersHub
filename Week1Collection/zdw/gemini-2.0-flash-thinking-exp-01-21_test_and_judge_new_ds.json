        "MLLM_answer": "- First image: An abstract representation of ten vertical lines with small squares at the ends.\n- Second image: A wooden abacus with red and white beads on a horizontal bar.\n- Relation: Counting structure\n- Explanation: The first image shows multiple vertical lines, which resemble the rods or wires used in an abacus. The second image is a photograph of an abacus, a tool for counting and calculation, which utilizes rods to hold beads. Both images depict structures relevant to counting or numerical representation.",

            "score_4o": "2",
            "score_reason": "While the MLLM output recognizes circular food elements, it misses the connection to pizza. The explanation is too broad and lacks the key insights about pizza composition and toppings found in the standard answer."

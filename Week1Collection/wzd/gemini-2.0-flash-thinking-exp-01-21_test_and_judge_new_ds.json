The second image is a graph of the stock market, a highly complex and sensitive system whose behavior can be volatile and difficult to predict, sometimes influenced by seemingly small factors. The two images together can evoke the idea that both natural and financial systems can exhibit sensitive dependence on initial conditions.",

They share a visual theme of intricate, outward-spreading patterns.",

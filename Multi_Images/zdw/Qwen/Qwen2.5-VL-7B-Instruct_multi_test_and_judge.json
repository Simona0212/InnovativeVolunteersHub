The rings could be seen as a representation of unity and connection, similar to how a dove can be a symbol of peace and harmony.

It's a silhouette with a white outline on a transparent background.\n\n- Second image: A pair of black pliers lying on a concrete floor next to a folded black scooter frame.\n\n- Relation: Resistance\n\n- Explanation: The first image represents a powerful visual symbol of resistance against systemic injustices such as racism, sexism, and other forms of discrimination. It encourages solidarity and a push for change. The second image, although seemingly unrelated at first glance, can be seen as a metaphorical representation of the tools necessary to effect that change. The pliers, which are often used to repair or dismantle objects, could symbolize the action required to break down barriers and dismantle oppressive systems. The scooter frame, another tool for personal transportation, might represent individual empowerment and the journey towards a more equitable world.

The second image might depict a tool used by herders to manage livestock, which are often found in rural areas where wildlife is also common. Therefore, both images could be related through the theme of the human-wildlife interaction in nature.",

In contrast, the second image presents an accessory that is often worn by humans, symbolizing human fashion. The relation between these two images can be seen in the way they both depict elements of their respective worlds — one from the wild and the other from human culture.

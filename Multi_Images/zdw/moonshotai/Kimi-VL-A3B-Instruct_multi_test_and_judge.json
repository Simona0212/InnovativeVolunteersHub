It is an irrational mathematical constant that appears frequently in geometry, art, architecture, and nature. The ratio is derived from the division of a line into two parts in such a way that the whole length divided by the longer segment is equal to the longer segment divided by the shorter one. This ratio is often denoted by the Greek letter phi (Φ). The image of the nautilus shell is a natural example of the Golden Ratio in action. The shell's spiral follows the Golden Ratio, with each chamber's size and shape reflecting the proportions of the ratio. This pattern is not only aesthetically pleasing but also efficient, as it allows for the shell to grow in a consistent and stable manner. The Golden Ratio is also found in various other natural and man-made structures, including the arrangement of leaves on a stem, the branching of trees, and the proportions of the human body.

Matcha tea is an integral part of traditional Japanese tea ceremonies, while cherry blossoms (sakura) are a symbol of beauty and the transient nature of life, often seen during spring events such as hanami (flower viewing).

Matcha is a ceremonial green tea that is prepared by grinding the leaves into a fine powder (as seen in the first image), which is then whisked into hot water during the traditional tea ceremony. Cherry blossoms, particularly the sakura, are the national flower of Japan and symbolize the transient beauty of life, often associated with the fleeting nature of spring.

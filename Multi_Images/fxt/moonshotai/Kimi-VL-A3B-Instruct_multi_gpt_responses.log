    "response": "- First image: [image concept]\n- Second image: [image concept]\n- Relation: romantic\n- Explanation: Both images evoke strong emotions of love and affection. The first image, with its bright sun and smiling face, symbolizes warmth and joy, which are often associated with romantic feelings. The second image shows a couple embracing and kissing, which is a clear representation of romantic love. The title \"Only You\" further emphasizes the theme of a deep, personal connection between two people. Although the images differ in their visual representation—one being a symbolic, animated sun and the other a real-life couple in a natural setting—the underlying theme of love and affection ties them together."

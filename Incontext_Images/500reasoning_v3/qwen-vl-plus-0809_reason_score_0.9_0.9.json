In Image 1, the man's hairstyle and attire could be seen as part of his personal style, while in Image 2, the woman's pose and the presence of photographers suggest she might be an artist or model being photographed for her work. Image 3 introduces a different form of artistic expression, focusing on the use of space and materials to create a striking visual impact. By creating Image 4, I aimed to maintain the connection between the individual and the artistic element, represented here by the shark in the tank, which adds a layer of intrigue and symbolism to the image. This parallels the way the woman in Image 2 stands out against the backdrop of the art gallery, drawing attention to herself and her surroundings.",

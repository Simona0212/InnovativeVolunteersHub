Applying this to Image 3, which depicts the fall of the Berlin Wall, a major historical event, Image 4 should similarly represent significant historical events. Therefore, Image 4 could be a collection of photographs of other pivotal moments in history, such as the end of World War II, the signing of the Declaration of Independence, or the fall of the Soviet Union, arranged in a grid to mirror the structure of Image 2.",

Image 1 presents a surrealistic figure with an eye for a head, while Image 2 shifts to a more abstract and patterned representation of human figures. The key here is the transition from surrealism to abstraction. To mirror this relationship, Image 4 should integrate the surrealistic element of a starry night sky (from Image 3) into a figure, while maintaining the abstract and vibrant style seen in Image 2. This would involve creating a figure with a head composed of the swirling stars and cosmic elements from \"The Starry Night,\" set against a backdrop of abstract patterns and bright colors, thus transforming the iconic night sky into a new, integrated form.",

Image 2 takes an everyday object, a toilet, and transforms it into a sculpture by covering it with fabric, elevating it to the status of art. Similarly, Image 3 shows a real soup can alongside an artistic depiction of the same can, highlighting the transformation of a mundane object into a piece of art. For Image 4, the idea is to take the Campbell's Tomato Soup can, much like the toilet in Image 2, and present it in an artistic form, such as a sculpted version made of an unconventional material, thus bridging the gap between the ordinary and the extraordinary in art.",

Both images evoke a sense of peace and introspection, with the vast landscapes providing a backdrop for quiet reflection. To mirror this relationship with Image 3, Image 4 should depict a similar theme but focused on the smaller scale of nature, such as a garden or a meadow. By placing a person observing the delicate beauty of flowers, particularly including the purple crocus, it creates a parallel experience of finding solace and wonder in the intricate details of nature.",

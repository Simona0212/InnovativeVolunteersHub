Both images showcase artistic expressions deeply rooted in Chinese heritage: the dragon tattoo symbolizes strength and good fortune, while the lion dance is a performance often seen during festivals and celebrations. Similarly, Image 4 should reflect the cultural significance and natural beauty depicted in Image 3.

The shield is a tool of defense and warfare, while the cornucopia is a symbol of prosperity and fertility.

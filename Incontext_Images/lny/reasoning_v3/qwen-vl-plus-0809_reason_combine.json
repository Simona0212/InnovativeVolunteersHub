Image 4, while not directly related to mythology, could be seen as representing a different form of mythology, specifically European medieval legends where knights and chivalry were central themes. The connection here is the use of fantasy and legend to represent historical or cultural narratives.",

For Image 3, the cartoon goat's pink cheeks could be interpreted as a reaction to surprise, similar to the expressions in Images 1 and 2. Therefore, Image 4 should depict someone reacting to something surprising, maintaining the theme of surprise across all images.",

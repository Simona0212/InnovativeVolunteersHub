The first pair represents the visual element of a gathering with people dancing, and the second pair represents the auditory element of a gathering with people singing. Both pairs focus on the interaction and enjoyment within the friendship group.  By applying this reasoning, the third pair suggests a group engaged in a game, and the fourth pair should depict friends engaged in story-telling.

The tree in Image 2 is rooted in the earth and endures the storm, similar to how the celestial figure in Image 4 connects with the physical world through the rooted tree.\n- **Explanation**: Both pairs of images depict a solitary entity (tree or figure) amidst a powerful natural force (storm or celestial light). The relationship shows how these entities find grounding and strength in their connection to the earth, whether through physical roots or through a spiritual reach. The second pair reflects this grounding theme, where the celestial figure reaches down to the tree, suggesting a link between the divine and the physical world. \n",

In the first pair, the eye physically reflects its surroundings. In the second pair, the man's expression and pose reflect his internal state of confusion. Applying this to the third image, the missing person poster shows a physical absence, reflected in the blank space for a photo.

The first pair contrasts a lively social scene with a child facing a bleak, snowy day. The second pair mirrors this contrast by replacing the screen with a window and the snowy day with a bright, sunny one. This creates a narrative arc that suggests moving from isolation to connection, from the indoors to the outdoors, and from a somber mood to a cheerful one. \n",

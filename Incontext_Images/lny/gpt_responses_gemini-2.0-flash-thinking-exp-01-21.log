A flowing, ethereal streak of light, representing a shooting star or cosmic path, connects the vast sky to the figure or the earth below, rendered with vibrant, non-realistic colors and textures.\n-   **Relation**: Symbolic Transformation / Dreamlike Interpretation\n-   **Explanation**: Image 2 transforms the grounded, magical scene of Image 1 into a more abstract, symbolic, and dreamlike composition, adding a human element and emphasizing atmosphere and color over literal depiction. Image 4 mirrors this relationship by taking the distinct cosmic phenomenon (shooting star/streak) and starry sky from the photographic realism of Image 3 and rendering it in a more abstract, emotional, and potentially human-centered way, shifting focus from objective observation to subjective or symbolic experience.",

Image 3 shows an empty wallet, which is a clear consequence of lacking financial restriction.

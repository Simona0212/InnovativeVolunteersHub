            "score_4o": "2",
            "score_reason": "The MLLM interprets the images through an 'imagination manifestation' theme, failing to connect to the theme of being absently dreamy as suggested by a Spanish expression. It constructs a symbolic relation of internal states manifesting externally; however, it does not resonate with the thematic analysis revolving around being scatterbrained or dreamy, resulting in an unrelated interpretation."

            "score_4o": "2",
            "score_reason": "The MLLM response addresses a 'symbolic manifestation of feeling,' which doesn't fully align with the standard's focus on the Spanish expression for being dreamy or scatterbrained. While it touches on freedom, belonging, and introspection, it misses the specific connection to the expression 'tener pájaros en la cabeza,' limiting its thematic relevance to the main concept."

            "score_reason": "The MLLM identified a broader relationship of static vs. dynamic elements but missed the specific cultural reference to 'Spanish expressions for being absently dreamy or scatterbrained.' The proposed Image 4 lacks the thematic connection needed to align with the intended standard reasoning, which focuses on the metaphorical use of birds around the head to show an imaginative or daydreaming state. There's no inclination to the Spanish expression 'Tener pájaros en la cabeza'."

            "score_4o": "3",
            "score_reason": "The MLLM identified the theme of 'Imagination Manifested', linking the imaginative activity to a resulting creative or dream-like outcome, which aligns with the general idea of the standard answer. However, it missed the specific cultural reference to 'Spanish expressions for being absently dreamy or scatterbrained.' The MLLM included elements of whimsy and imagination but diverged in its representation compared to the intended metaphorical imagery with cartoon birds."

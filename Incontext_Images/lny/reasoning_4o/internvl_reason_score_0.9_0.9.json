In Image 4, the person sitting under the tree with a book and a quill pen further emphasizes the theme of creativity and expression.

While Image 1 and Image 2 both depict boats, they are expressed through radically different artistic traditions - impressionism vs. traditional Chinese art - creating a strong contrast that draws the eye. Similarly, Image 3 and Image 4 both showcase landscapes, but through an opposing lens - landscape painting which is rooted in realism, juxtaposed with surrealistic art which is centered around creating dreamlike, fantastical scenes.",

Explanation: Both pairs present a man in a suit with a gag around his mouth and looking shocked, suggesting a narrative of surprise or distress. In the pair of images that includes Image 2, the magician represents an element of magic and trickery, while the rabbit popping out of the hat could symbolize unexpected outcomes. When creating Image 4, I combined these elements with the visual theme of the man in a suit and the woman in a red dress to explore this narrative from a different perspective. The inclusion of the magician and the rabbit introduces an additional layer of surprise and mystery to the scene.",

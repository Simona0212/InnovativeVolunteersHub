- **Image 3**: A diagram of a prokaryotic cell.
- **Image 4**: A diagram of a eukaryotic cell.
- **Relation**: Food preservation.

- **Image 2**: A whole cucumber and several slices of cucumber on a white background.
- **Image 3**: A diagram of a cell in a hypotonic solution, with the cell's volume decreasing as it loses water.
- **Image 4**: A diagram of a cell in a hypertonic solution, with the cell's volume increasing as it absorbs water.
- **Relation**: The relationship between **Image 1** and **Image 2** is that the pickles in the jars are made from cucumbers, which are the whole and sliced cucumbers in **Image 2**. The relationship between **Image 3** and **Image 4** is that they both depict the effects of osmosis on cells, with **Image 3** showing the cell losing water and shrinking in a hypotonic solution, and **Image 4** showing the cell absorbing water and swelling in a hypertonic solution.
- **Explanation**: The pickles in the jars are made from cucumbers, which are the whole and sliced cucumbers in **Image 2**. The process of pickling involves soaking the cucumbers in a solution of vinegar, water, and spices, which causes the cucumbers to shrink and become firm. This is similar to the process of osmosis, where water moves from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration. In **Image 3**, the cell is in a hypotonic solution, which means that the concentration of solutes inside the cell is higher than the concentration of solutes outside the cell. As a result, water moves out of the cell, causing it to shrink. In **Image 4**, the cell is in a hypertonic solution, which means that the concentration of solutes outside the cell is higher than the concentration of solutes inside the cell. As a result, water moves into the cell, causing it to swell.

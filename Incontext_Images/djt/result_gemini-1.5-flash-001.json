        "- **Image 1**: Diagram illustrating the internal structure of a prokaryotic cell.\n- **Image 2**: Diagram illustrating the process of osmosis in a hypotonic solution, where water moves into a cell.\n- **Image 3**: A photo of two whole cucumbers and several sliced cucumbers.\n- **Image 4**: [**Image 4**: A diagram illustrating the internal structure of a cucumber cell, with labels highlighting the cell wall, chloroplasts, and vacuole.] \n- **Relation**: Cellular structure and function.\n- **Explanation**: Image 1 and Image 2 depict a connection between the structural components of cells and their functional roles. Image 1 shows the simpler structure of a prokaryotic cell, while Image 2 demonstrates how water movement across a cell membrane can affect cell volume. Image 3 provides a visual of a cucumber, and Image 4, by illustrating the internal structure of a cucumber cell, links the observable features of the cucumber with the underlying cellular processes. Just as the cell wall provides rigidity to a plant cell, the cucumber's firm texture is a result of its cell structure. Similarly, the cucumber's internal water content is related to the vacuole's size and water-storing capacity. \n",
        "- **Image 1**: A diagram illustrating osmosis, the movement of water across a semipermeable membrane from a region of high water concentration to a region of low water concentration.\n- **Image 2**: A comparison of prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, highlighting their structural differences and the presence of internal organelles.\n- **Image 3**: A row of jars filled with various pickled vegetables.\n- **Image 4**: [A diagram of a jar filled with pickled cucumbers with a zoomed-in view of a single cucumber showing bacterial cells in the pickle solution.] \n- **Relation**:  **Osmosis and Microorganisms**\n- **Explanation**: Both Image 1 and Image 2 explore cellular processes, while Image 3 provides a visual of preserved food. Image 4 links these concepts by illustrating how osmosis plays a role in preserving food.  Just as water moves across the membrane in Image 1, microorganisms in the pickle solution (Image 4) may experience changes in water movement due to the high salt concentration in the brine, influencing their growth and survival. The pickled cucumbers in Image 3 are a product of this interplay between osmosis and microorganisms. \n"

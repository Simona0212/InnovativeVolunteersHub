Image 3 shifts to a completely different realm by featuring characters from an animated film. To mirror the relationship, Image 4 should depict a character from \"Snow White\" engaged in a real-world activity, such as cooking, to bridge the gap between the fictional world and everyday life. The chosen activity (cooking) and the character (the Evil Queen) would provide a stark contrast similar to that between Images 1 and 2.",

Image 1 uses the surreal combination of an elephant and a human arm to create a dreamlike scene, while Image 2 uses the paradoxical statement to question the nature of reality. Similarly, Image 3 uses symbolism to represent the emotional bond between two individuals through the connected hearts. To mirror the relationship between Image 1 and Image 2, Image 4 should use a simple illustration of a heart with a paradoxical statement to challenge the viewer's perception of what a heart truly is.

The contrast here is between stillness and motion, solitude and community. Similarly, Image 3 presents a bird in flight, embodying freedom and movement against a calm sky. To mirror this relationship, Image 4 should depict a scene of urban life, filled with the hustle and bustle of a city at night, contrasting with the solitary flight of the bird in Image 3. This juxtaposition highlights the dynamic between individual freedom and collective energy.",

In Image 1, the friends are engaged in a board game, which allows them to enter into a world of make-believe and adventure. This parallels Image 2, where the castle represents a magical, fantastical realm that one might imagine or dream about. For Image 4, the idea is to mirror this relationship with Image 3. The person in Image 3 appears to be lost in thought, possibly dreaming or imagining something beyond their immediate surroundings. To reflect the imaginative and escapist theme, Image 4 should depict a scenario that suggests a retreat into one's own thoughts or stories, such as reading a book by a fireplace, which can transport the reader to different worlds and adventures.",

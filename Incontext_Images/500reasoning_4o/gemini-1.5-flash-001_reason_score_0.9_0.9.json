The remaining measures are similar to image 2, featuring a similar arrangement of notes to image 1.]\n- **Relation**: Orchestration\n- **Explanation**: The relationship between image 1 and 2 shows how a solo clarinet piece is orchestrated for a larger ensemble, including orchestra, where the solo line is accompanied by additional instruments. Image 4 mirrors this relationship by taking the solo line in Image 3 and setting it within an orchestral arrangement, as in Image 2. This creates a contrast between the individual voice in the solo and the fuller sound in the orchestral setting. \n",

Image 2 represents destruction through the consuming nature of fire.  In the same way, Image 4 depicts the destruction of time, symbolized by the clock being consumed by fire, mirroring the relationship between the first two images.  The remaining faint outlines suggest a sense of time passing and things fading away. \n",

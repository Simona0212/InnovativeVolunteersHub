Image 3 is a forest, a common setting in folklore. Image 4, the Leshy, is a mythical forest spirit deeply tied to and often embodying the forest itself, mirroring the relationship of a figure (Leshy) associated with its primary setting (Forest).",

Image 2 presents a figure associated with a cold, ethereal, or magical realm in nature.

Similarly, Image 3 is a symbolic representation of historical power (the ruler), and Image 4 is a functional structure (the palace or castle) that houses and enables that power.

Image 2 is an artistic, stylized depiction of a historical person, representing a translation from reality/history into a different visual medium (like illustration or digital art). Image 3 is a photograph of a real tree in a landscape.

Following this pattern, Image 3 shows a natural structure (a rustic building). Therefore, Image 4 personifies a natural force, such as rain or storm, that impacts buildings.

Image 2 is the natural material itself (crystal). Similarly, Image 4 is a crafted object (tire) made from natural latex, the source of which is shown in Image 3 (rubber tree). Both pairs illustrate the transformation from a natural raw material source to a finished human-made product.",

Applying this same relationship, Image 3 shows a finished product (an ancient pottery amphora) which is made from clay. Therefore, Image 4 represents the raw material (clay) used to create the object in Image 3.",

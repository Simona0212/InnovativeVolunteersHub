During the run-up, the athlete accumulates kinetic energy; at the moment of takeoff, this kinetic energy is converted into potential energy, allowing the athlete to leap and fly forward. This principle is also applied in trampoline design, where the compression and release of springs convert stored potential energy into kinetic energy, helping athletes perform various aerial maneuvers. Similarly, In curling, players use brooms to sweep the ice in front of the stone to change its sliding distance and trajectory. The heat generated by sweeping slightly melts the ice surface, increasing the friction between the stone and the ice, thus slowing down the stone or changing its direction. This principle is also applied in winter tire design, where special tread materials and patterns increase the friction between the tires and icy roads, enhancing grip and safety.",

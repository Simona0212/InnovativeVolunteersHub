Following this pattern, Image 3 shows an iconic element of witchcraft (a bubbling cauldron), so Image 4 is conceived as the character (a witch) who uses such an element.",

Similarly, Image 3 shows Nylon, a synthetic material (fiber). Image 4 (natural cotton fibers) represents a natural material (fiber) that serves a similar function to Nylon (e.g., in textiles, ropes), establishing a parallel relationship where the synthetic material acts as a counterpart to the natural one.",

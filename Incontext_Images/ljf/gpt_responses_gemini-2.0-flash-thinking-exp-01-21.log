Image 2, a human creation, features art (mosaic) that symbolically represents or echoes this natural light phenomenon. Image 3 is a basic human-made light source (a candle). Image 4, a single bright star in the night sky, serves as a natural counterpart or parallel to the candle's solitary light in darkness, completing the parallel by contrasting a human light source with a natural one.",

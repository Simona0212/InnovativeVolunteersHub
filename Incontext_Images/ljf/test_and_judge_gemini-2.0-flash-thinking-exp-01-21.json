Image 3 (anchor) is a tool specifically designed for anchoring, and Image 4 (ship) is the object that uses the anchor for stability. The relationship in both pairs connects a structure/vessel to its method of remaining stable or fixed in place.",

Image 2 displays a grand structure built upon a solid, rocky base. Similarly, Image 3 depicts a base camp, which serves as the foundation or starting point for the ascent towards the mountain's summit, represented as the structure or objective in Image 4.",

Mirroring this, Image 4, a caravanserai, functions as a crucial support and resting point for travelers on land journeys, often located near important structures like the fort in Image 3, providing necessary resources and stability before or after interacting with the fort or continuing travel.",

Applying this relationship to the second pair, Image 4 (sprout in a miniature decorative pot) serves as a cultivated and perhaps artistically presented counterpart to the natural sprout emerging from the earth shown in Image 3, reflecting human intervention and presentation.",

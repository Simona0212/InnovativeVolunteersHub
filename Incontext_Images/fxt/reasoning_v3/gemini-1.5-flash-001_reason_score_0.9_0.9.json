Image 2, a Bauhaus building, exemplifies how these principles were applied to architecture, resulting in clean lines, functional layouts, and geometric forms. Similarly, Image 3 showcases how geometric shapes can be utilized to create unique and functional architectural elements like staircases. Image 4, a modern building, represents a shift towards more organic and fluid forms, while still retaining the core geometric principles seen in Bauhaus architecture. \n",

Both images use a similar visual approach, with the person looking off into the distance, symbolizing a sense of purpose and potential. The posters both incorporate a slogan that emphasizes the positive aspects of joining the organization. \n",

Image 2 shows the installation of Picasso's \"Guernica,\" a powerful political statement. The relationship between an artist and their creation is central to both images, serving as a visual representation of the act of artistic expression and its influence on the world. Image 4, therefore, should depict an artist standing proudly before their own work, reflecting the same concept of artistic creation.",

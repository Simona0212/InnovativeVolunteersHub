Image 1 presents a surrealistic figure with an eye for a head, while Image 2 shifts to a more abstract and patterned representation of human figures. The key here is the transition from surrealism to abstraction. To mirror this relationship, Image 4 should integrate the surrealistic element of a starry night sky (from Image 3) into a figure, while maintaining the abstract and vibrant style seen in Image 2. This would involve creating a figure with a head composed of the swirling stars and cosmic elements from \"The Starry Night,\" set against a backdrop of abstract patterns and bright colors, thus transforming the iconic night sky into a new, integrated form.",

Both images highlight specific works (Symphony No. 5 and Symphony No. 40) and provide visual cues related to classical music, such as the bust of Beethoven and the formal portrait of Mozart. To mirror this relationship, Image 4 should feature another significant work by a classical composer, such as Bach's Brandenburg Concertos, and include a visual element that reflects the historical period of Baroque music, such as a painting of musicians in Baroque attire. This maintains the theme of showcasing iconic compositions alongside imagery that evokes the era of the composer.",

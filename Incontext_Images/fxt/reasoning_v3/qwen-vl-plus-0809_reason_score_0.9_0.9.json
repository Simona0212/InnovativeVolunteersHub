Similarly, Image 2 shows two versions of the same product, highlighting the importance of brand consistency and recognition. Image 3 and Image 4 also share a theme of everyday objects transformed into art pieces, challenging our perceptions of what constitutes art and how it can comment on societal norms and expectations. By creating Image 4, I aimed to maintain the playful and subversive nature of Image 3 while introducing a new element of transformation and commentary on the mundane aspects of life.",

Image 3 shares a similar theme of surrealism through the depiction of the women holding hearts, which adds an element of fantasy to the otherwise realistic portrayal. Image 4 should reflect this surrealistic theme by incorporating fantastical elements into the scene of two figures holding hands, such as floating hearts or a whimsical background, thus mirroring the surreal nature found in Images 1 and 2.",

The blue metallic dog sculpture in Image 1 is a whimsical piece that challenges perceptions of materials and form, while the shark in Image 2 is encased in glass, creating a juxtaposition between natural and artificial environments. Image 4 takes inspiration from these concepts by presenting a variety of photographs as a single, cohesive artwork, much like how the individual pieces of the dog sculpture and the shark installation contribute to a larger narrative. This approach allows viewers to engage with multiple perspectives and interpretations within a single exhibit, mirroring the interactive nature of the art installations shown in Images 1 and 2.",

Both images can be connected by the theme of reflection, as the artist reflects on her work and the hourglass reflects the fleeting nature of time . In Image 3, the man is reflecting on himself, which ties back to the idea of reflection seen in Image 1 and 2. For Image 4, I created a scene where the person is sitting and reflecting, mirroring the introspective nature of Image 3. The relation \"Time and Reflection\" connects all four images, showing different aspects of how people engage with their surroundings and thoughts over time.",

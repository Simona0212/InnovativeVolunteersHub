Image 3, which showcases Cubism’s geometric abstraction, can similarly inspire architectural design. In Image 4, the relationship can be mirrored by designing an architectural concept that reflects the principles of Cubism, translating abstract and dynamic forms into structural design.",

Image 1 focuses on a well-preserved column, while Image 2 features the broader context of ruins, highlighting historical preservation and destruction. Image 3, a classical statue, similarly portrays an art piece with significant historical value but in a partially preserved state. Image 4 should mirror this by presenting a similarly notable piece of ancient sculpture, capturing the sense of historical wear and the artistic style of its era.",

They emphasize the beauty and expression found in these art forms, each using a distinct medium and style. Image 3 is a colorful artwork conveying the beauty of nature. In response, Image 4 should portray a landscape in a more subdued grayscale palette, mirroring the transformation from vibrant performance/dance in Image 2 to a serene, monochrome form in Image 1.",

The style is Impressionistic, depicting movement and atmosphere.\n- **Image 2**: A lively social gathering of people sitting and standing around a table laden with food and drinks on a terrace, possibly overlooking water. The scene captures a moment of leisure and conversation in an outdoor or semi-outdoor setting. The style is Impressionistic, focusing on light and color in a genre scene.\n- **Image 3**: A harbor scene at sunrise or sunset, with industrial elements, ships, and smaller boats on calm water reflecting the light of a prominent orange sun.

The first pair contrasts a public, bustling urban setting (Image 1) with a more private, relaxed social leisure setting (Image 2). The second pair mirrors this by contrasting a working/industrialized natural setting (harbor in Image 3) with a more serene, purely natural or rural setting (Image 4), highlighting the variety of scenes and moods captured by Impressionism.",

Similarly, Image 3 shows a group (a choir) in a performance or rehearsal setting, representing the application of vocal skills. Image 4 would represent the instruction phase for a choir, such as a director teaching vocal technique or leading a lesson.",

Similarly, Image 3 shows a person with a tool (laptop), implying interaction or potential use. Image 4, therefore, is conceived as the tool itself (laptop), mirroring the representation of the violin in Image 1.

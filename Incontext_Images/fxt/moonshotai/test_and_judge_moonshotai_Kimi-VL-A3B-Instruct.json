            "MLLM_answer": "### Image 1\n**Image Concept**: Fibonacci Sequence\n- The image displays the Fibonacci sequence, a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. The sequence starts with 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610, 987, and so on. The text explains that each number is the sum of the previous two numbers.\n\n### Image 2\n**Image Concept**: Golden Ratio\n- The image illustrates the golden ratio, a mathematical concept where the ratio of two quantities is the same as the ratio of their sum to the larger of the two quantities. The image shows a spiral that approximates the golden ratio, with the ratio of the lengths of segments labeled as 61.77 and 38.22, resulting in a value of approximately 1.618. The image also includes a visual representation of how the golden ratio can be applied to various shapes and designs.\n\n### Image 3\n**Image Concept**: Cubist Art\n- The image depicts a cubist painting, characterized by its use of geometric shapes and fragmented forms to represent the subject. The painting features a face with angular, abstract features, using a palette of blue, yellow, and orange hues. The background is composed of various geometric shapes and blocks of color, creating a dynamic and visually engaging composition.\n\n### Image 4\n**Image Concept**: Abstract Geometric Art\n- The image is an abstract geometric painting that uses a combination of shapes and colors to create a visually striking composition. The painting features a face with angular, fragmented features, similar to the cubist style. The use of geometric shapes and a limited color palette creates a sense of depth and complexity, with a focus on the interplay of light and shadow.\n\n### Relation\n**Relation**: Connection through Mathematical and Artistic Principles\n- Both Image 1 and Image 2 explore mathematical concepts that have been influential in various fields, including art and design. The Fibonacci sequence and the golden ratio are both mathematical principles that have been used to create aesthetically pleasing compositions in art. Similarly, Image 3 and Image 4 both showcase the use of geometric shapes and abstract forms in art, reflecting a connection through the application of mathematical principles in artistic expression.

Just as Image 2's bird represents escape and liberation, Image 4 uses the same imagery to suggest breaking free from the constraints depicted in Image 1, creating a dynamic interplay of themes between the two pairs of images.",

This setup evokes the idea of writing or creativity.\n\n- **Relation**: Freedom versus Confinement\n- **Explanation**: The first image juxtaposes the freedom and liberation of flight against the captivity and restriction of the prison cell (Image 2). Thus, we can draw an analogy for Image 1 and Image 3: The notebook and quill represent a space of creative expression, much like the bird signifies freedom. Therefore, for Image 4 and Image 3, the notebook and quill set up a similar theme as the bird and sunset in Image 1, highlighting the notion of liberation through creation or expression.",

The creation of Image 4, a family crest or coat of arms, serves as a visual representation connecting to Image 3. In heraldry and family history, crests are often used alongside family names to symbolize lineage and heritage.

Both images share an aesthetic of refined minimalism - the rope is clean and functional, while the crowned fox embodies grandeur. Image 3 (yellow nails) conveys a sense of casual luxury through its vibrant color and simple design. Therefore, Image 4 (abstract feather) complements this theme by embodying lightness and elegance, as feathers are often associated with beauty and grace. The color gradient suggests a subtle shift in style, similar to how the transition from the straightforward rope to the majestic fox showcases a change in tone from utility to royalty.",

Image 1's simplicity reflects elegance through the classic shape of the infinity symbol, while Image 2 uses bright yellow nail polish against a soft pink background to add vibrancy and personality. Similarly, Image 3 and Image 4 contrast the static stillness of a crowned fox with the dynamic energy of a flying bird. The fox represents stability and royalty, whereas the bird signifies freedom and change.

The scene is depicted within an architectural setting with arches.\n- **Image 2**: A modern photograph of an author sitting at a table signing books at a book signing event in a bookstore. There is a large banner promoting their book and stacks of books on the table.\n- **Image 3**: An intricate illuminated manuscript page featuring large, decorative capital letters, detailed border illustrations with plants, animals (dogs, birds, fish), musical notation, and handwritten text (calligraphy) in a formal script. It is a piece of art as well as text.\n- **Image 4**: A piece of modern graphic design or digital art where typography is the primary artistic element. It could feature stylized text, experimental layouts, or the use of modern design software to create visually striking compositions centered around written words, perhaps a modern book cover, poster, or digital editorial layout.\n- **Relation**: Evolution of Text Craft / Dissemination\n- **Explanation**: Image 1 shows the historical *process* of creating text (writing manuscripts) in a medieval setting. Image 2 shows the modern *outcome* and *dissemination* of text (a published book being signed by the author). Similarly, Image 3 represents a historical *art form* centered around text (an illuminated manuscript).

Images 3 and 4 are illustrations referencing iconic elements strongly associated with Edgar Allan Poe, a master of gothic horror and mystery literature (\"The Black Cat\" and \"The Raven\").

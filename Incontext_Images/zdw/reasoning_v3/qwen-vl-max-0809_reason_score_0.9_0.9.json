Image 2, while not as well-known, represents a specific type of insect in its natural habitat. Similarly, Image 3 shows a common baking ingredient, flour, in a way that is familiar to many people. To mirror the relationship between Image 1 and Image 2, Image 4 should depict a recognizable scene from the baking process, such as kneading dough, which is a fundamental step in bread-making. This creates a parallel where both pairs feature iconic or familiar representations of their respective subjects.",

Image 1's red ceiling evokes the idea of a fiery sky, similar to how Van Gogh's brushstrokes evoke the swirling movements of the night sky in Image 2. Image 4 carries this connection forward by visualizing a space that echoes the grandeur of the St. Petersburg station in Image 3 but with a more abstract, celestial theme, referencing the sky and the stars in Image 2.

Image 3 shows a more formal romantic gesture of being close together, while Image 4 takes that relationship further with the man kneeling down and offering his hand to the woman.

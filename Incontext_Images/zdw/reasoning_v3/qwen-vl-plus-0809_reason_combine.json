To mirror this relationship for Image 3 and Image 4, I created Image 4 featuring a woman who could be a celebrity or a public figure, similar to how Marilyn Monroe and the man in Image 3 are public figures. The green forest background adds a natural element that contrasts with the urban setting of the Hollywood sign, much like the contrast between the man's formal attire and the casual, everyday setting of the Hollywood sign.",

Image 3 directly represents celebration, specifically a birthday party. To mirror this relationship for Image 4, I would choose an image that conveys a sense of learning or personal achievement, which is often celebrated. Therefore, Image 4 could represent someone celebrating their reading progress or academic success by holding a book. This connection emphasizes the idea of celebration across different contexts: musical performance, curiosity and playfulness, and personal accomplishment.",

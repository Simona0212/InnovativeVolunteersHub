They are wearing different colored clothes and the quote \"A movie for anyone who's ever felt like they were different\" is included.\n\nRelation:\nThese three sets of images are related by the theme of the Eiffel Tower and the concept of feeling different.\n\nExplanation:\nBoth Image 1 and Image 2 feature the iconic Eiffel Tower, suggesting a connection to the movie \"Amélie\". In this way, the group in Image 2 might be fans of the movie or the theme of feeling different, as seen in Image 3. The design of Image 4 uses the Eiffel Tower to represent the location of the movie and the five individuals could represent the different personalities in the movie, as seen in Image 1. The quote in both Image 3 and the created Image 4 emphasizes the theme of feeling different and unique, which is a key theme in the movie \"Amélie\".",

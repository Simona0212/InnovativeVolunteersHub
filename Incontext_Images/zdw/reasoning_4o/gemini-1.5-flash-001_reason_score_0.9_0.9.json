The text in Korean says \"Always\" and includes the title of the soundtrack.\n- **Relation**:  Romantic gesture in the context of a drama\n- **Explanation**: Both pairs of images depict romantic relationships with similar gestures in the context of a drama. Image 1 shows the man comforting the woman, and Image 2 shows a more romantic gesture of helping her up. Image 3 shows a more formal romantic gesture of being close together, while Image 4 takes that relationship further with the man kneeling down and offering his hand to the woman. The use of Korean text in both Image 2 and Image 4 reinforces the connection. \n",

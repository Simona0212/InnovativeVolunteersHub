Red wine is a staple of French cuisine and culture, while the Eiffel Tower is the most recognizable landmark of Paris and France as a whole. To mirror this relationship, Image 4 (Arc de Triomphe) was chosen to pair with Image 3 (coffee/tea). The Arc de Triomphe is another iconic Parisian monument, often associated with the French café culture represented by the cup of coffee or tea.

Big Ben is synonymous with London and British culture, while tea is deeply ingrained in British daily life and social customs.

The hammer is designed to drive nails into wood or remove them. To mirror this relationship, Image 4 would be a banana, which is a primary food source for many monkey species. Just as the hammer is designed to interact with nails, a monkey's hands and digestive system are adapted to peel and eat bananas. This maintains the \"tool and target\" relationship, where the monkey's physical adaptations are the \"tool\" and the banana is the \"target\" or intended object of interaction.",

The makeup vanity is a place where people prepare their appearance, often dividing their face into areas for different cosmetic applications. Similarly, the restroom entrance divides people into separate spaces based on gender, where they may also prepare their appearance.\n\nTo mirror this relationship, Image 4 (sliced bread) would relate to Image 3 (whole loaf) in a similar way. The whole loaf represents the unaltered state, like an unprepared face or undivided group. The sliced bread shows the preparation for consumption and the division into individual portions, much like how makeup divides and prepares the face, or how restrooms divide people into separate spaces.",
